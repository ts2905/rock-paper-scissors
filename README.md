## Installation

1. Fork this [remote repository](https://github.com/ts2905/rock-paper-scissors) under your own control, then "clone" or download your remote copy onto your local computer.
2. Navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd my-first-python-app
```

3. Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "my-first-env":

```sh
conda create -n my-first-env python=3.8
conda activate my-first-env
```

4. After activating the virtual environment, install package dependencies (see the ["requirements.txt"](/requirements.txt) file):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
